These routines contain bug fixes and enhancements and are not included in the project zip file or in the KIDS 
build contained therein.  These will need to be copied over the routines of the same name after the build
is installed.  Most of the fixes in the notes due related routines are to make them work properly with new
VistA reminders code that was enhanced to check for undesirable recursion.  However, this code will work on
the prior code as well so go ahead and install it.
